- 👋 Hi, I’m @cynweldon ::waves::  
- 👀 I’m interested in living an abundant and fulfilling life for myself and my son who has autism.
- 🌱 My goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer.  I am currently working through Generation USA Junior Web Developer Boot Camp, as well as Dr. Angela Yu's course "The Complete 2022 Web Developer Bootcamp".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other people who are currently working in that role so I can learn, grow and help others.
- 📫 How to reach me... you are welcome to email me at cynweldon@gmail.com or reach out to me on Facebook.  Thank you for welcoming me into this community.  I hope to be of service to others.  Blessings!
